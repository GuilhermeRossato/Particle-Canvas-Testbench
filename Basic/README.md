# Obfuscated Particle Canvas Testbench

This demo focuses on good programming practices, abstracting a lot of concepts into modules and classes and leaving the code easily modifiable.

The code base is found in [this class](https://github.com/GuilhermeRossato/ParticleCanvasTestbench/blob/master/Basic/Script/Classes/Application.js). The other classes are supposedly less specific.
